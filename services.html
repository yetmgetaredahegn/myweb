                On the server-side, I build and maintain the logic, databases, and APIs that power your web applications. With a focus on creating scalable and efficient back-end systems, I handle tasks such as database management, server-side programming, and security measures. My aim is to work together to ensure that your application's back-end supports its front-end effectively and securely.            </p>

I look forward to collaborating with you to build innovative solutions that grow and adapt to your evolving needs.            <div class="s-box">
